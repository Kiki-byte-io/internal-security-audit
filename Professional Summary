## üõ°Ô∏è Internal Audit Summary ‚Äì Botium Toys

As part of the Google Cybersecurity Certificate, I completed a simulated internal audit for a fictional company called **Botium Toys**, which operates both a physical storefront and an expanding online business.

This project gave me hands-on experience in identifying potential security risks, checking which security controls were in place, and evaluating how well the company is meeting important regulations like **PCI DSS**, **GDPR**, and **SOC 2**.

### What I Did:
- Reviewed Botium's current systems, employee access, and data protection setup
- Filled out a detailed controls and compliance checklist using the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework** to check whether the firm security regulations are in compliance with the law or the government.
- Rated their security risk level and identified areas that could lead to vulnerabilities or fines
- Wrote clear recommendations to help them improve their overall security posture

This audit gave me a practical understanding of how internal audits work and how to connect cybersecurity frameworks with real-world business risks. It's the kind of work I‚Äôd love to keep doing in a professional role.
